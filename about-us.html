            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>Welcome to Spin The Wheel, your go-to solution for making random decisions fun, fair, and effortless! We believe that sometimes, the best way to make a choice is to leave it to chance, and our tool is designed to do just that with style and simplicity.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p class="mission-statement">
                Our mission is to provide a high-quality, easy-to-use, and customizable spinning wheel tool that helps individuals, educators, event organizers, and teams make unbiased selections, inject excitement into activities, and simplify decision-making processes, all within a sleek and user-friendly interface.
            </p>

            <h3>Why This Wheel?</h3>
            <p>In a world फुल of choices, sometimes the most liberating thing is a simple spin. We created this tool because we saw a need for a straightforward, reliable, and ad-free (or minimal ad) random picker that users could depend on. Whether you're a teacher looking for a fair way to call on students, a marketer running a giveaway, or just trying to decide what to have for dinner, our wheel is here to help.</p>
            <p>Key features we focused on include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Get started in seconds – just type your entries and spin.</li>
                <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Tailor the wheel with custom entries, weights, colors, fonts, and sounds to fit your exact needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Our algorithm ensures that selections are random, and weighted entries are proportionally represented.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy-Focused:</strong> All your data (entries, settings) is stored locally in your browser. We don't collect it.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Designed to be functional and clear across different devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>We are a small team of enthusiasts who love creating simple yet powerful tools. This spin the wheel is one of our projects aimed at making everyday tasks and fun activities a little bit easier and more exciting.</p>

            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
            <p>We are always thinking of ways to improve spin the wheel. Future ideas include [e.g., "more themes," "advanced sharing options," or "sound customization"]. We value user feedback, so if you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out!</p>

            <p>Thank you for using our spin the wheel!</p>
